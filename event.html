        <p>
            To start with, I would like to give some information about Hour of Code. The Hour of Code is a one-hour
            introduction to computer science created by <a href="https://code.org/" target="_blank">Code.org.</a> With involvement from
            180 nations and 45 languages, it
            has grown into a worldwide movement. In this event, students learn the basics of coding with interesting
            games. Each year, the Hour of Code campaign takes place during Computer Science Education Week, which will
            be held from December 6 to 12 in 2021. For more information check out the official webpage of
            <a href="https://hourofcode.com/az/en" target="_blank">Hour of Code.</a> I and my teammate approached two schools for
            holding an Hour of Code event. Unfortunately,
            the first school we asked refused our offer. So, we go to the second school, which is Elitist Gymnasium
            named after Ilyas Afandiyev. So, first, we will give a short introduction of ADA University and our school,
            which is the School of IT and Engineering(SITE). After completing the introduction, we will start doing
            tasks with students. We expect to have 25 students around. Rufat will explain tasks to students in projector
            and Elvin will help students individually. During the event, we will take videos and photos and publish them
            on social media in order to support this event.
