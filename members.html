                Rufat Ismayilov. I can hear that you are asking who is this Rufat Ismayilov. I do not want you to wait.
                So, Rufat is 17 years old and he is a freshman at ADA University. His major is Information
                Technology(IT). Why ADA University and why exactly IT? ADA University is a world-class university and is
                the best in Azerbaijan. Moreover, its campus is unique among other universities in the country. To be
                more precise, we have a smart and green campus. The buildings look aesthetic. Besides that, students are
                provided with the latest technologies for more modern and comfortable study. To come to the second
                question, IT is one of the most fundamental parts of the world. When I started high school I decided to
                go into this field. Because it was always interesting to me that what is going behind the computer,
                website or software. I believe that with the help of ADA University I will be part of the <b>IT Special
                    Forces</b>.

                I am Elvin Aliyev. I studied in several schools. To start with, I studied in the school called
                “Pishavari” then I moved to school number 276. I studied 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> classes in
                the Russian sector. Then I switched to the Azerbaijani sector. In 10th grade, I applied to ADA School.
                Fortunately, I got enrolled in ADA School. And I studied 10th and 11th grade in ADA. Then after
                graduating I applied to ADA University. And I choose the Information Technology faculty. Because I
                believe that I can take the best education in the field of IT from this university. What is more, ADA
                gives me a beautiful future. For that reason, I choose this university.
